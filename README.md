# ASP.NET 4 in C# 2010
- web application framework
- open-source
- server-side (scripting): a technique used in web development which involves
 employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each user(clinet's)
 request to the website.
- designed for web development to produce dynamic web pages
- It was first released in January 2002 with version 1.0 of the .NET framework and is the successor to
  Microsoft's Active Server Pages (ASP) technology.
- ASP.NET is run on the common language runtime, allowing programmers to write ASP.NET code using any supported
 .NET language.
- ASP.NET web pages, known officially as web forms, are the main building blocks for application development in ASP.NET.
- Web forms are contained in files with an ".aspx" extension; these files typically contain static (x)HTML markup, as well
  as markup defining server-side web control and user control.
- Microsoft recommends dealing with dynamic program code by using the code-behind model, which places code in a seperate file
 or in a specially designated script tag.
- Code files typically have names likes MyPage.aspx.cs while the page file is MyPage.aspx.
- The developer writes code to respond to different events, like the page being loaded, or a control being clicked,
 rather than the procedural walkthrough of the document.
